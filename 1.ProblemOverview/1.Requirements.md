# Requirements for Architecture Consideration

## 1. Ability to track multiples vital signs per patient
- At least 8 sensors per patient should be tracked over WBAN
- More vital signs / devices can added in the future to the existing system
- An average response time of 1s or less should be respected when sending data to Monitor
- Provides visual analytics based on realtime data processing which are integrated in a live stream data workflow
- Operate by itself with a scheduled activity

## 2. Stores historical and live data of each vital sign
- Stores time based data in a high volume
- Provides past 24h stored data searching capabilities
- Provides live data stream analysis capabilities
- Stores a snaphost of an aggregation of signs measurement at requested time

## 3. Provides advanced alerting capabilities
- Threshold alerts which are based on fixed, predefined values or thresholds for every vital sign
- Statistical alerts which rely on statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to detect anomalies
- Allow composite state definition (Awake, Asleep) for a patient that can be used into alerting rules
- Push notifications to smartphones running the company's mobile application, and also on Monitor screens

## 4. Ensure operational resilience per device / vital sign
- Detect and isolate a failed device / sensor to not affect the system overall operations for the others

## 5. Ability to serve for a maximum of 500 patients per Instance
- The system should be deployed as a scalable infrastructure on-Premise 
- The infrastructure on-premise should have high security garantees due the storage of recorded raw monitoring data


# Assumptions

- MonitorMe system data that are transfered through an API, are compliant to the existing system MyMedicalData
- After 500 monitored patients, the MonitorMe enrollment process should be disabled
