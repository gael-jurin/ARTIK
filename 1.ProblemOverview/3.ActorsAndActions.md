### Device Uses:
1. **Patient Monitoring Devices**:
   - Heart Rate Monitor: Measures the patient's heart rate. Vital for assessing cardiac health. Transmits readings every 500 milliseconds.
   - Blood Pressure Monitor: Measures the patient's blood pressure. Essential for cardiovascular assessment. Transmits readings every hour.
   - Oxygen Level Monitor: Measures the patient's oxygen level. Critical for assessing respiratory function. Transmits readings every 5 seconds.
   - Blood Sugar Monitor: Measures the patient's blood sugar level. Important for managing diabetes. Transmits readings every 2 minutes.
   - Respiration Monitor: Measures the patient's respiration rate. Key for assessing lung function. Transmits readings every second.
   - ECG Monitor (Electrocardiogram): Measures the patient's ECG. Essential for detecting cardiac abnormalities. Transmits readings every second.
   - Body Temperature Monitor: Measures the patient's body temperature. Vital for assessing overall health. Transmits readings every 5 minutes.
   - Sleep Status Monitor: Determines whether the patient is asleep or awake. Helps assess sleep patterns. Transmits status updates every 2 minutes.

2. **Other Devices**:
   - Nurse Station: A centralized monitoring screen located at each nurses' station, where medical professionals can view consolidated vital sign data of patients. There is a maximum of 20 patients per nurses' station and each patient can be viewd with auto pagination in every 5 seconds.
   - Mobile Devices (Smartphones, sensors): Medical professionals receive alert push notifications on their smartphones and may also receive alerts through sensors, ensuring they are promptly notified of potential health issues detected by the MonitorMe system.


### Systems Used:

### MonitorMe
- **Purpose:** A medical patient monitoring system for hospitals.
- **Functionality:**
  - Reads data from eight different patient-monitoring equipment vital sign input sources: heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, blood sugar, respiration rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, and sleep status.
  - Sends the data to a consolidated monitoring screen per nurses station with an average response time of 1 second or less.
  - Records and stores the past 24 hours of all vital sign readings for each patient.
  - Analyzes each patient's vital signs and alerts medical professionals if it detects an issue or reaches a preset threshold.
  - Adjusts alerts based on whether the patient is awake or asleep.
  - Continues to function if any vital sign device or software fails.
  - Allows medical staff to generate holistic snapshots from a patient's consolidated vital signs and upload them to MyMedicalData.
- **Deployment:** On-premises system, with each physical hospital location having its own installation.
- **Capacity:** Maximum of 500 patients per physical MonitorMe instance.

### MyMedicalData
- **Purpose:** A comprehensive cloud-based patient medical records system.
- **Functionality:**
  - Used by doctors, nurses, and other health professionals to record and track a patient's health records.
  - Guarantees partitioning between patient records.
- **Integration:** Allows the upload of patient snapshots from MonitorMe through a secure HTTP API call.
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based system.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Does not have to meet any government regulatory requirements such as HIPPA.
