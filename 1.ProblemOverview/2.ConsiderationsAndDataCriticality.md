### Considerations:

1. **Patient Confidentiality**:
   - Ensure that patient data is securely handled and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.

2. **On-Premise Deployment**:
   Deploy the MonitorMe system on-premise to maintain control over patient data and ensure compliance with regulations.

3. **System Reliability**:
   - Implement measures to ensure the MonitorMe system operates reliably without frequent downtime or disruptions.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Design the system to handle potential future increases in the number of monitored vital signs and additional features.

5. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Ensure that vital sign data collected by patient monitoring devices is accurate to support reliable analysis and decision-making.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Adhere to relevant regulations and standards governing the handling and storage of medical data, even if not explicitly mandated by law.

7. **User Training and Support**:
   - Provide comprehensive training and ongoing support to Medical Professionals and Administrators to effectively use and manage the system.

8. **Data Management**:
   - Handle both real-time streaming data from wearable sensors and IoT devices, as well as historical data from previous health records. Ensure the system is capable of managing big data with high velocity, characterized by numeric and time-oriented nature.

### Data Criticality:

| Data Type             | Criticality  | Observation                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Patient Vital Signs   | High         | Accuracy and timeliness are crucial for patient monitoring and timely intervention.  |
| Patient Medical Records | High         | Comprehensive patient records are vital for providing quality healthcare and treatment. |
| User Account Information | High     | User accounts must be protected to prevent unauthorized access to patient data. |
| Alert History        | High         | Historical data on alerts aids in analyzing trends and improving patient care.        |
| System Logs          | Medium       | System logs are important for troubleshooting issues and maintaining system integrity. |
