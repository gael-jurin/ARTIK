# Adaptive Alerting ADR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system needs to adjust alerting mechanisms based on the patient's status, particularly whether they are awake or asleep.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Accuracy in identifying patient status (awake/asleep).
- Adaptive alert thresholds based on patient status.
- Real-time adjustment of alerting mechanisms.
- Integration with patient monitoring data to determine status changes.
- Minimization of false alerts during status transitions.

## Options

- Develop custom algorithms to detect patient status based on vital sign patterns.
- Utilize existing sleep monitoring technologies for patient status detection.
- Implement rule-based systems for adaptive alerting based on known status patterns.

## Decision

Develop custom algorithms to detect patient status based on vital sign patterns and integrate this information into the alerting mechanism to adjust thresholds and minimize false alerts during status transitions.

## Implications

### Positive

- Provides accurate adaptation of alert thresholds based on patient status.
- Enhances patient safety by minimizing false alerts during status transitions.
- Facilitates better customization and optimization of alerting mechanisms.
- Supports real-time adjustment of alerts based on dynamic patient conditions.

### Negative

- Requires significant development effort for algorithm implementation and testing.
- Dependency on accurate and reliable vital sign data for patient status detection.
- Potential complexity in algorithm tuning and optimization.
- Additional computational resources may be needed for real-time analysis.
