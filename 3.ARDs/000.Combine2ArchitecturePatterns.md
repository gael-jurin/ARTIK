# Use space-based and microservices architecture

## Status

Confirmed

## Context

[Analysis of the architecture characteristics](../2.DetailedSolution/ArchitecturePatterns.md) required of the system and the possible architecture styles concluded that 2 architectures would suit the development of the system, with less trade-offs than adequate options.

## Decision

Use space-based architecture for the device based monitoring capabilities of the system and microservice architecture for management components.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Aggregate suitable characteristics highly toped.

**Negative:**

- Cost needs to be mitigated.

**Risks:**

- Cost and scalability may still be high trade-offs after mitigation.
