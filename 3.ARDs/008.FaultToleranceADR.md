# Fault Tolerance ADR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system needs to maintain functionality in the event of vital sign device or software failures to ensure continuous patient monitoring.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Ability to continue monitoring vital signs despite device or software failures.
- Minimal disruption to monitoring processes during failure recovery.
- Redundancy measures to mitigate single points of failure.
- Data integrity and accuracy maintenance during failure scenarios.

## Options

- Implement redundant monitoring devices for each vital sign.
- Utilize failover mechanisms to switch to backup devices or software.
- Develop error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures without data loss.

## Decision

Implement failover mechanisms to switch to backup devices or software in the event of vital sign device or software failures. This ensures continuous monitoring of vital signs with minimal disruption to patient care.

## Implications

### Positive

- Ensures continuous patient monitoring even during device or software failures.
- Reduces the risk of data loss or interruption to patient care processes.
- Enhances reliability and availability of the monitoring system.
- Supports seamless transition between primary and backup monitoring components.

### Negative

- Requires additional resources for implementing and maintaining failover mechanisms.
- Increased complexity in system architecture and configuration.
- Dependency on effective monitoring and maintenance of backup devices or software.
