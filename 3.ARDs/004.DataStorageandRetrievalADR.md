# Data Storage and Retrieval ADR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system needs to efficiently store and retrieve patient vital sign data for analysis and historical tracking.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Data storage capacity to accommodate large volumes of vital sign data.
- Fast retrieval times for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- Robust data backup and recovery mechanisms.
- Secure storage to protect patient confidentiality.
- Scalability to handle increasing data loads over time.

## Options

- Utilize a relational database management system (RDBMS) for data storage.
- Integrate Time-Series database for time tracking data.
- Implement a NoSQL database for flexibility and scalability.
- Use a combination of storage solutions for different types of data.

## Decision

Implement a combination of storage solutions, opting for a relational database to handle structured data and a time series database for efficient management of time-based data. This strategic choice optimizes storage capacity, retrieval times, and scalability for enhanced performance.

## Implications

### Positive

- Maximizes storage efficiency by leveraging a relational database for structured data and a time series database for time-based data.
- Enables fast retrieval times for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- Provides flexibility to accommodate various data types, ensuring comprehensive data management.
- Enhances scalability to handle increasing data loads over time, ensuring system performance remains robust.

### Negative

- Requires integration efforts to synchronize data between the chosen relational and time series databases.
- Adds complexity to the data management process due to the utilization of multiple database systems.
- Potential overhead in terms of maintenance and monitoring, necessitating efficient resource allocation.
- Additional training may be needed for personnel managing the intricacies of multiple database systems effectively.
