# Data Source Integration ADR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system requires integration with various data sources to collect vital sign information for patient monitoring.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Compatibility with different types of vital sign monitoring devices.
- Efficient data transmission and retrieval mechanisms.
- Scalability to accommodate future additions of monitoring devices.
- Ensure data accuracy and integrity during transmission and storage.

## Options

- Implement direct integration with each monitoring device.
- Utilize a middleware solution for standardized data integration.
- Develop custom adapters for each device type.

## Decision

Utilize a middleware solution for standardized data integration to streamline the integration process and ensure compatibility with diverse monitoring devices.

## Implications

### Positive

- Simplifies integration process with various monitoring devices.
- Provides a standardized interface for data transmission.
- Enhances scalability and flexibility for future device additions.
- Reduces development effort for individual device adapters.

### Negative
