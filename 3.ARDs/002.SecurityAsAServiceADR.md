# Security as a Service ADR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system requires integration with various components type and less privilege access is required.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Compatibility with different types of software components.
- Scalability to accommodate future additions of monitoring devices.
- Ensure data encryption and integrity at transit.

## Options

- Implement direct authentication with each component.
- Utilize a CAS solution for standardized security integration.
- Use a service based security implementing standard authorization flows and access control protocols.

## Decision

Use a service based security implementing standard authorization flows and access control protocols to streamline the integration process and ensure secururity and auditability with every software component (External device, mobile application, Api, ...).

## Implications

### Positive

- Simplifies integration process with various components.
- Provides a standardized interface for security.
- Enhances scalability and flexibility for future component additions.
- Reduces development effort for individual security adapters.

### Negative

- Initial domain configuration and definition of centralized the scopes and roles.
- Additional training may be needed for maintenance personnel.
